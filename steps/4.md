# Step 4: Add system test coverage

In this step, you will add system tests to catinabox. System tests are the most
valuable kind of tests because they use your system the way the user will.

1. Run the existing system tests:

  ```bash
  py.test tests/system/
  ```
  
  You can see that there are ___ existing tests.

2. Open the existing tests:

  ```
  ```
  
  Notice:
    * Fixtures
    * HTTP client


3. Identify what has not been tested, add system tests, run the tests.

4. Commit the tests to your branch, push, and run branch tests.

5. If you get stuck, take a look at the solution.
